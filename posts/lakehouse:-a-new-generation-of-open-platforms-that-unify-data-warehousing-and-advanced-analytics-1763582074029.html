<h1>Lakehouse: A new generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics</h1><p><i>11/19/2025, 2:54:34 PM</i></p><hr><b>Motivation: Data Warehousing Challenges</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>DW </b>are critical for business processes, but they have the problem of incorrect data, staleness, high costs.</div><div>First problem is data quality and reliability, in the 2 tier architecture with data lake and DW involved there can be differences in the semantics, SQL dialects, data may be stored in different schema, increased # of pipelines &amp; jobs. With all these the probability of failures and bugs are high.</div><div>Second problem is that most business requires up to date data, but with multiple ETL jobs for the data to load into DW will make it stale( in sense of time taken to load from data lake to DW).{ Streaming jobs are even harder to maintain}.</div><div>Third, Now a days companies are collecting data in the form of unstructured data{images, videos, text} and Data warehouse cannot support.</div><div>Finally deploying ML or No SQL type code on Data Warehouses.</div>
