<h1>Lakehouse: A new generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics</h1><p><i>11/19/2025, 1:03:12 PM</i></p><hr>The authors tried to answer the question of " is it possible to turn data lake based on standard open data formats such as parquet, ORC into high performance systems that can provide both performance and management features of data warehouses and fast, direct I/O from advanced analytics workloads."<div><ol><li>Reliable data management on data lakes: Lakehouse needs to be storing data just like the data lakes, but misses the features of transaction rollback, zero copy cloning. <b>Delta Lake</b> and <b>Apache Iceberg</b> have come up with provision of these features on data lake.</li><li>Support for Machine Learning and Data Science: users can directly take the data from data lakes and also data scientists tend to use data frames for abstraction from <b>declarative data frames API</b> in manipulating the data as they offer more optimization options while working with ML workload this make Lakehouse efficient for ML and Data science workloads.</li><li>SQL Performance: Lakehouse needs to provide state of the art SQL performance for parquet/orc files, in contrast DW uses sql to optimise everythinh under the hood, however variety of techinques can be used to maintain auxilary data about the datasets and to optimize data layout within these existing formats to achieve competitive performance.</li></ol><div>Results are provided for performance comparision of Lakehouse SQL and leading cloud data warehouses on TCP-DS</div></div>
